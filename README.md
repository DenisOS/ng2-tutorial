# Denis Tour of Heroes

My implementation of angular2 (Tour of Heroes tutorial)[https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/]

## some notes
* senor john papa has taken the tutorial further than the angular site and added routing and dashboard; its (on github here)[https://github.com/johnpapa/angular2-tour-of-heroes]
* good article on (styles and angulars use of shadow dom)[http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2015/06/29/shadow-dom-strategies-in-angular2.html]. I use "encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Native" and can see the css is added not in the html but the shadow dom, thats interesting.
# externalize html and css
